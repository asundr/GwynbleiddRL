# WitcherRL
An early build of a roguelike game. Written in Java.

In WitcherRL you descend into a procedurally generated system of caves with the goal of finding a trophy worthy
of being brought back to the surface.

Your quest will be aided by items you find and impeded by hunger and hostile creatures. If you find yourself in combat with such a creature
you can attack them by walking into them or by using a ranged attack. Creatures will drop items that you can eat.
If you lose yourself in the caves, you can dig through the walls but at the
cost of more hunger.

A list of the current controls can be accessed during gameplay by pressing '?'.

I began building this project by reading through:

This project uses Trystan's AsciiPanal to display the game tiles:
